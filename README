Compose
=======

A simple app to compose emails. Currently lacking a lot of features
(including the ability to not crash when given broken mail headers)
but it works ok with mutt. Possibly useful if you need to compose a
plaintext email and save it to a file.

TODO
----

* Create new headers (currently only editing existing ones is
  possible).

* Better message parsing, specifically all the rules in rfc5332 about
  handling old and busted mail.

* The ability to hide headers.

* Better sizing of the header pane.

* Mime and all the madness that comes with it.
